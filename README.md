As an alternative to generating statistics using Python and Pandas, this notebook is driven by
SQL queries using the [Erdgast API](http://ergast.com/mrd/) and [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15). As such the notebook needs to be viewed in Azure Data Studio as only raw code will be visible on GitHub.

For a quick view there is my article on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/asking-different-questions-f1-stewart-wareing/)

This database has been built using [![Azure](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/azure?icon=azure&label)](https://azure.microsoft.com/) cloud services. It is an Azure SQL Database and forms part of my study for the DP 300 Exam. All queries are written in <span style='color:red'>T-SQL</span>
